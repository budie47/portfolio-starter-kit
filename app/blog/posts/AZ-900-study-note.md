# DOMAIN 1: Describe Cloud Concept

- describe cloud computing
- shared reponsibility model
- cloud models, - public, private and hybrid
- Appropriate use cases for each cloud model
- desc consumption-based model (budget and pricing)
- compare cloud pricing models
- desc serverless

## 1.1 Define Cloud Computing

according to NIST SP 800-145  - “Cloud computing is a model for enabling universal, convenient, on-demand network access … to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

According Microsoft - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet

Expands the traditional IT offerings to include services like 

IoT

ML

AI

## Share Responsibility Model

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled.png)

## Better Security in the Cloud ?

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%201.png)

## 1.1 Describe Cloud Model

Benefits of Cloud Computing -  Cloud is **COST EFFECTIVE, GLOBAL, SECURE, SCALABLE, ELASTIC and ALWAYS CURRENT**

|  | Public Cloud | Private Cloud | Hybrid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description | datacenter in your public cloud platform | Cloud env in your own datacenter | combination private and public cloud |
| Advantages | Scalability, agility, PAYG, no maintenance, and low skills | can support legacy system / software, full control and compliance | allow your apps run in the right location with right use cases  and can leverage benefit both public and private cloud |

### Economies of Scale

The ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale. 

### Capital Expanditures

CapEX is spending of money on physical infrastructure up front

### Operating Expenditures

OpEX is spending money on services or products now and being billed as you go

**CLOUD INCREASING OPEX SPENDING AND REDUCING CAPEX SPENDING**

| Consumption-based model  | Pay for what you use , typically per unit of time or capacity (per minute, per-GB, per-execution) |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed price model | You provision resources and pay for those instances whether you use them or not - ensure predictable cost for business  |
| Serverless Architecture  | a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

hosted as a pay-as-you-go model based on use.

Resources are stateless, servers ephemeral and often capable of being triggered.

example : Function-as-service |

### Different between PaaS and Serverless

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%202.png)

### Serverless services

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%203.png)

| Logic App | Functions | Event Grid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate task, business processes and workflows | An event driven, compute-on-demand experiance that extends the existing Azure application platform  | Enables you to easily manage events across many different Azure services and applications  |
| can choose from a gallery of hundreds of pre-built connectors for MSFT & 3rd party service | … with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure as well as on-premises systems. | Once a subscription is created, Event Grid will push events to the configured destination |
| Foundation of Power Automate (MS Flow) | Enable billing per execution rather that by time | Makes it easy for any developer to utilize the “push” model instead of the inefficient “pull” across their Serverless architecture |

- describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
- describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
- describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

AVAILABILITY : → Encompasses availability of the infrastructure, application, and services, Generally expressed as a number of 0’s

SCALABILITY : → The ability of the system to handle the growth of the users or work

ELASTICITY : → The ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on the app demand

AGILITY : → Focuses on the speed and ease of allocating and deallocating resources. Allow for vast amounts of computing resources provisioned in minutes

FAULT TOLERANCE → The ability of the system to handle faults in a service like power, network, or hardware failures - refer to component level failures

HIGH AVAILABILITY → The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time - refer to services level failures

DISASTER RECOVERY → The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. - generally focuses on recovery in the event of a service or site failure

RELIABILITY → The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to functions

Consist of the two principles

RESILIENCY - aim to return an application to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs

AVAILABILITY - consistent access to your application - uptime 

### Characteristics common in cloud platforms and services

RAPID ELEASTICITY AND SCALABILITY

→ Allows the customer to grow or shrink the IT footprint as necessary to meet needs without excess capacity

- What different ?
    - Elasticity → the ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on app demand.
        - capabilities can be rapidly provisioned and de-provisioned (scale-in, scale-out) - Additional instances quickly auto-deployed
    - Scalability → The ability of the system to handle growth of users or works.
        - Ability to grow as demand increases. - controlled by SKU or tier selection
        - 
    

PREDICTABILITY → Azure enables solutions with predictable cost and performance 

### SECURITY IN AZURE

- Protection of customer data (access control, encryption)
- Protection of cloud applications
- protection of cloud infrastructure

**IAAS Use Cases**

- During testing and development. VMs provide a quick and easy way to create different OS and application configurations.
    - Test and Dev teams can easily deploy and then delete the VMs when they no longer need them.
- When running application in the cloud. Can provide technical and financial benefits, as when an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand.
    - Shutting down VMs when you don’t need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only resources you use.
- When extending your datacenter to the cloud. Can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network
    - Make it easier/ less expensive to deploy than on-premises
- During disaster recover. Enables significant cost saving by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery.
    - Enables push button, automated VM spin up and shutdown in a disaster.

Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network or custom cloud apps

External resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and many SaaS apps. 

AUTHENTICATION METHODS IN AZURE.

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%2026.png)

SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) → 

- single sign-on means a user doesn’t have to sign into every application they use
- The user logs in once and that credential is used for multiple apps
- often called “**modern authentication”**

MFA →

- Entra ID works by requiring two or more the following authentication methods:
    - Something you know (pin or password)
    - Something you have (trusted device)
    - Something you are (biometric)
    

**OATH TOKENS**

OATH (Open Authentication) is an open standard that specifies how time-based, one-time password (TOTP) codes are generated. 

Software OATH tokens (Example: Microsoft Authenticator App

- Typically applications. Entra ID generates the secret key, or seed that into the app and used to generate each OTP

Hardware OATH tokens

- small hardware devices that look like a key fob that displays a code that refreshes every 30 or 60 seconds, with secret key / seed pre-programmed.

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%2027.png)

**FIDO2/ PASSWORDLESS**

What is FIDO2 and how does it work?

AZURE RBAC

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%2035.png)

Built on Azure Resource Manager and provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources

(one element of implementing “least privilege”)

ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE

THREE Principle of Zero Trust

1. Verify explicitly
    1. Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
2. Use least privileged access
    1. Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
3. Assume breach
    1. Segment access to minimize blast radius
    2. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

ZERO TRUST SECURITY MODEL

Unlike the “trust but verify” approach, in Zero Trust, no entity is trusted by default.

It based on three principles: Assume breach, verify explicitly, and least privilege access

 

| Identities | - Identities should be explicitly verified with strong authentication using all available data points and Users should be granted least privilege access |
| --- | --- |
| Devices | should be monitored for health and compliance and updated when necessary |
| Apps | Only approved apps should be allowed to access company data, and permissions managed |
| Data | should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes, at rest and in motion. |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure version, configuration, JIT access, should be managed. - Telemetry should be used to detect anomalous activity that may indicate attack |
| Network | Networks should be segmented to limit data access and reduce threat exposure - Real time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed. |

Defense in-Depth → A layered (defense in depth) approach that does not rely on one method to completely protect your environment. 

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%2037.png)

Defender for Cloud → A unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your cloud and on-premises data centers.

- Provides security guidance for compute, date, network, storage, app, and other services
- Include support for both Azure and on-premises workloads, as well as other public clouds (support multi-cloud)

## 3.1 Describe cost management in Azure

- Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure
- Compare the pricing calculator and the Total Cost Ownership (TCO) calculator
- Describe cost management capabilities in Azure
- Describe the purpose of tags

DESCRIBE FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT COSTS

1. COST IMPACTS → Factors that can affect Azure resource costs include resource types, services, locations, ingress and egress traffic. 
2. REDUCING COST → Factors that can reduce costs include reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing. 

DESCRIBE METHOD FOR PLANNING AND MANAGING COST

Reserve Instances 

- Reserve virtual machines in advance and save up to 72 percent compare to PAYG pricing with 1-yr or 3-yr commitment

Reserve Capacity

- Achieve significant savings on Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Cache for Redis (Discount is product-specific)
- Enables you to more easily manage costs across predictable and variable workloads and help optimize budgeting and forecasting - Also include 1-year and 3-year options

Hybrid Use Benefit

- A licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud
- Let’s you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Servicer licenses on Azure

Spot Pricing 

- Access unused Azure compute capacity at deep discounts - up to 90 percent compared to pay-as-you-go prices
- Apply to Azure VMs only!!!
- Use for Workloads that can be interrupted without harm

Pricing Calculator

- Interactive calculator that allows you to estimate the expected monthly Azure cost.
- Can choose region, services, options and SKUs.

TCO Calculator

- A tool that helps estimate cost savings you can achieve by migrating application workloads to Azure
- Allow you to compare the TCO of different Azure services and regions and provides a details breakdown of cost components and potential savings.

Azure Cost Management

- A suite of tools provided by Microsoft that help you analyze, manage, and optimize costs of your workloads.

Tags

- A name and value pair used to logically organize Azure resources, resource groups and subscriptions into a logical taxonomy
- Tags can be the basis for applying business policies or tracking costs
- You can also enforce tagging rules with Azure Policies
    - Example of common tags include owner, cost center, app/service and environment

## 3.2 Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance

**DESCRIBE AZURE GOVERNANCE FEATURES**

MICROSOFT PURVIEW

WHAT IS AZURE RESOURCE MANAGER ?

![Untitled](AZ-900-study-note/Untitled%2041.png)

- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure
- It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update and delete resources in your Azure account .

INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CODE (IaaC)

- the management of infrastructure (networks, VMs, load balancers, and connection topology) described in code
- just as the same source code generates the same binary, code in the IaaS model results in the same environment every time it is applied.
- IaaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
